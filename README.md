inspired by [Rob Spectre](http://brooklynhacker.com). His code for the Donald Trump filter laid the groundwork for this extension.

The western media reproduce fear and prejudice, when they report on the latest terrorist attack. They're amplifying the terrorists message which have a restrictive effect on normal citizens. We are afraid. We shouldn't be afraid. We should ignore the threat of those who only want to harm us, in that way their mission will fail. This extension is your self-defence and only real protection against the message of jihad, which are being broadcasted by the western media. 

This extension provides you with two ways to make your view on the world and web surfing experience better. The first way is the "ignorant" option. What it does is simply to remove terror related content because getting no news is better than spreading fear. 
The other option is enlightened and like the ignorant option it looks through web pages to locate unwanted content, but then it replaces it with better and more positive content. One of the main problems when western media brings stories about terrorism, is the irrational fear that is planted in the mind of you and me. Irrational fear of terror attacks, but mainly you start to fear innocent people who happens to have the same religion, same skin color or descent from the same country. With the enlightened setting, you get news about food festivals, beautiful valleys and fascinating history. That helps you get rid of your prejudice and gives you a new way to explore and relate to other people and their culture. 

The internet should be a free place and we shouldn't let us restrict by anyone. Installing the "Terror of Ignorance & Enlightenment" extension isn't self-censorship, quite on the contrary. It gives you freedom to not give in to fear. It gives you control over the way you experience news
